/*
Now let's try arithmetic in Java. You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers and store them in variables like this:

int sum = 34 + 113;
int difference = 91 - 205;
int product = 2 * 8;
int quotient = 45 / 3;
Instructions
1.
Set the int variable myNumber equal to the product of two numbers.

public class Arithmetic {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int myNumber = 8 * 9;
		System.out.println(myNumber);

	}
}
