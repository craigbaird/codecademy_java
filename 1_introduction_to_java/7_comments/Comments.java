/*
A comment is text you want Java to ignore. Comments allow you to describe code
or keep notes.

By using comments in the Java code, you may help yourself and even other programmers
understand the purpose of code that a comment refers to.

In Java, there are two styles of comments: single line comments and multi-line
comments.

Single line comments are one line comments that begin with two forward slashes:
// I'm a single line comment!
Multi-line comments are generally longer comments that can span multiple lines.
They begin with * / and end with * /

Instructions
1.
The statement on line 4 prints out Noise!. Ask Java to ignore it by commenting
it out. Place two forward slashes (//) at the beginning of line 4.
2.
Write a multi-line comment that begins anywhere after the single line comment
you just wrote. Again, the comment can say anything you like.
*/

public class Comments {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

//		System.out.println("Noise!");

/*
This is a
multiple line
comment
*/

	}
}
