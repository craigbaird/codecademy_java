/*
Good work! Let's explore one more special math operator known as modulo.

The modulo operator - represented in Java by the % symbol - returns the remainder
of dividing two numbers.
For example, 15 % 6 will return the value of 3, because that is the remainder left
over after dividing 15 by 6.
Instructions
1.
Use the modulo operator to set the variable myRemainder equal to 2. You can use
any two numbers that return a remainder value of 2.
*/

public class Modulo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int myRemainder = 8 % 6;
		System.out.println(myRemainder);

	}
}
