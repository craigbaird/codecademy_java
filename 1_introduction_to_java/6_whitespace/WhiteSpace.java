/*
Before we explore what we can do with variables, letâ€™s learn how to keep code
organized in Java.

Whitespace is one or more characters (such as a space, tab, enter, or return)
that do not produce a visible mark or text. Whitespace is often used to make code
visually presentable.

Java will ignore whitespace in code, but it is important to know how to use
whitespace to structure code well. If you use whitespace correctly, code will be
easier for you and other programmers to read and understand.

Instructions
1.
The given code is poorly formatted. Place System.out.println(isFormatted); on
line 5 so that it is easier to read.
*/

public class WhiteSpace {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		boolean isFormatted = false;
    System.out.println(isFormatted);

	}
}
