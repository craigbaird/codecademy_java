/*
Perfect. Let's look at one more Java data type: char.

The char data type is used to represent single characters. That includes the keys
on a keyboard that are used to produce text.

char is short for character and can represent a single character.
All char values must be enclosed in single quotes, like this: 'G'.
Instructions
1.
In between the parentheses of System.out.println(); type any single character of
your choice. Make sure it's enclosed in single quotes!
