Classes: Syntax
One fundamental concept of object-oriented programming in Java is the class.

A class is a set of instructions that describe how a data structure should behave.

Java provides us with its own set of pre-defined classes, but we are also free to create our own custom classes.

Classes in Java are created as follows:

//Create a custom Car class

class Car {

}
The example above creates a class named Car. We will define the behavior of the Car data structure in the next exercise.
Instructions
1.
In the code editor, create a Dog class. Use the example above to help you. For now, you can ignore the line(s) of code at the bottom. We will return to it later in this lesson.
